# Scouting Site To-Do list

- [ ] Make another php page that aggregates the details of each match
- [ ] Design wager system w/ sign in number & password
  - [ ] Store session tokens in database to stay logged in on reload
  - [ ] Update people's wagers after a match ends, e.g. when a stand scouting form is submitted
- [x] Submit multiple pictures at once
- [ ] Add comments directly to a picture from Pit.php (Is this really necessary?)
