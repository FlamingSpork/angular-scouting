# Scouting Site To-Do list

- [ ] Make a new table for team information gathered from the API to reduce number of requests
- [ ] Make another php page that aggregates the details of each match
- [X] Design wager system w/ sign in number & password
  - [X] Store session tokens in database to stay logged in on reload
  - [X] Update people's wagers after a match ends, e.g. when a stand scouting form is submitted
- [X] Submit multiple pictures at once
- [ ] Add comments directly to a picture from Pit.php (Is this really necessary?)
